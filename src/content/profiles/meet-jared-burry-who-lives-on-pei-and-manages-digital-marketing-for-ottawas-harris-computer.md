## How did you get into IT?

I got into IT through a combination of passion and opportunity. As a child, I was always fascinated by technology and how it worked. I would often take apart my family's computers and other electronic devices to see how they were built and how they functioned. As I grew older, I realized that a career in IT would allow me to pursue my passion for technology while also providing a stable and well-paying job.

## Can you describe your background and how you came to this point in your school?

My background is in computer science, I have always been fascinated by technology and how it works. As a high school student, I got into computer science by accident. At one point a few years ago, while I was browsing the web, I stumbled upon a motivational video on cybersecurity and I got hooked. I started to teach myself how to code during my spare time. I found it very interesting and challenging, and I decided to pursue a degree in computer science.

I took computer science classes in high school and participated in various competitions, such as CyberPatriot, which helped me to gain recognition in the cybersecurity field. I also took online courses to improve my skills, and I was thrilled to have placed around 50% in gold tier in the CyberPatriot competition, which was a great accomplishment for me.
